What works: The core memory bank files have been created and the projectbrief.md, productContext.md, activeContext.md, systemPatterns.md, and techContext.md files have been populated with initial content. The systemPatterns.md file has been updated with a detailed description of the architecture and component relationships, including the color palette. The frontend tech stack has been identified and documented.

What's left to build: Further refine the content of the memory bank files and add any additional context files as needed. Build the new `/agent` page.

- Created memory bank folder and core files
- Populated projectbrief.md with content from frontend PRD.md
- Added light/dark theme information to projectbrief.md

Current status: The memory bank is in the analysis and documentation phase. The frontend tech stack and color palette have been identified.

Known issues:

- **Tagging and synonyms options disappear from previous replaced sentences in the history.**

## Paraphrasing Tool Progress

- Understood the client-side data flow of the paraphrasing tool.
- Documented the data flow in `activeContext.md`.
- Identified the key components involved in the paraphrasing process: `ParaphraseContend.jsx` and `ParaphraseOutput.jsx`.
- Analyzed the socket events used for real-time communication with the server: `paraphrase-plain`, `paraphrase-tagging`, and `paraphrase-synonyms`.
- Documented the user interactions with the output, including the ability to change phrasal words and rephrase sentences.
- Analyzed the `RephraseSentenceNav` component and its role in the rephrasing process.
- Documented the history of rephrased sentences being saved in a state, allowing the user to access and toggle through the history.
- Documented that the user can send their input with multiple modes (standard, Send their input with multiple modes standard flowing standard, Fluency, formal, academic, etc.), with "standard" being the default, and that there is a language option, and although the language is auto-detected, the user can manually set the language. The server sends the response based on the selected mode and language.
- Documented that when we receive the plain text from the server, we need to split it into sentences. even Bangla text should be split by (ред) and the rest of the language should be splitted by (.).
