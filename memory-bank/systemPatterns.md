The system architecture consists of React for the UI, Next.js for routing and server-side rendering, and Material-UI for the component library. Key technical decisions include using Redux Toolkit for state management and React Hook Form for form handling. The system uses a dual authentication system with email/password login and Google login.

The frontend uses a layered architecture with React components for the UI, Next.js for routing and server-side rendering, and Material-UI for styling. The application uses Redux for state management, with separate slices for `auth`, `inputOutput`, `settings`, and `tools`, and custom hooks for reusable logic. The `components` directory is organized into subdirectories based on features (e.g., `auth`, `b2b`, `blog`, `home`, `navigation`, `payment`, `pricing`, `tools`). The application supports light and dark themes, which are configured using Material-UI's theming capabilities. The `MUIProvider` component is used to apply the theme to the application. The `useResponsive` hook is used to make the application responsive to different screen sizes.

The platform provides the following tools:

- Paraphrasing: Automatically rewrite sentences or paragraphs while preserving the original meaning.
- Grammar Correction: Real-time detection and correction of grammatical errors, punctuation issues, and spelling mistakes.
- Humanized AI Writing: Transform AI-generated text to sound more natural and human-like.
- Translation: Translate text between multiple languages with high accuracy.
- Summarization: Generate concise summaries of long documents or articles.
- Deep Research: Conduct research across the web, academic sources, and YouTube to gather relevant information.
- AI Detection: Identify whether a piece of text was generated by AI or written by a human.

The platform uses a dual authentication system with email/password login and Google login.
