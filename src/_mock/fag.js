            While Shothik AI is designed to produce text that can bypass many AI
            detection systems, it&apos;s important to note that no solution can
            guarantee 100% undetectability. AI detection technology is
            constantly evolving, and results may vary depending on the specific
            detector used. However, Shothik AI is built to stay ahead of the
            curve and provide the best possible results. For optimal results, we
            recommend continuously testing and adjusting your content to ensure
            the best possible outcomes.

          <p>
            The main difference is that the <strong>Panda model</strong> is
            optimized for general-purpose language processing, while the{" "}
            <strong>Raven model</strong> is designed for more specialized tasks
            like writing essays, research papers and SEO writing. The Raven
            model is more advanced and capable of producing more complex and
            detailed content, to generate high-quality content that we
            recommend. However, the Panda model is generally faster and more
            cost-effective for general-purpose writing.
